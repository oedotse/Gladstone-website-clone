            <p>The 2017 introduction of the Free SHS policy marked a transformative moment in Ghana’s education system,
                ensuring access to secondary education for all eligible students in Ghana.
                This policy has led to an increase in enrollment rates and has relieved many families from the financial
                burden of school fees.
                Since the introduction of the Free SHS policy, enrollment in secondary education has seen consistent
                increases. At the same time,
                government has made significant financial commitments to sustain the program. According to the 2024
                mid-year budget, government has committed GHC 9.9 billion to the program since inception.
                Further, the government launched various initiatives aimed at improving the quality of education,
                including the deployment of ICT tools in schools and the training of teachers in modern pedagogical
                methods.
                Despite these efforts, challenges such as overcrowded classrooms, inadequate infrastructure and
                uncertainty in the educational calendar persist.
                The latter has led to confusion among parents and students and often school administrators.</p>

            <p>While increasing funding and building infrastructure are essential,
                addressing these challenges requires a deeper structural transformation of Ghana’s secondary education
                system.
                I have identified three interrelated characteristics of secondary education in Ghana that require
                national dialogue and review.
                First is the overbearing emphasis on enrolling students in boarding schools.
                Many students in Senior High Schools are in the boarding system with many parents and students not
                interested in enrolling as day students.
                The emphasis on boarding schools is further exacerbated by disparities in the quality of education
                received across schools in the country.
                Some schools, particularly those in rural communities lack the resources (i.e., teachers, teaching
                materials and physical infrastructure) needed for effective teaching and learning.
                As a result, students often leave their communities to enroll in boarding schools for better education.
                The two characteristics noted, together contribute to the third, elitism in secondary school selection
                and enrollment.
                Schools perceived as having high-quality teaching and resources are nearly impossible for the less
                privileged to enroll in.</p>

            <h3>Revisiting the Community Day School Initiative</h3>
            <p>During the recent campaign, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) promised to review and enhance the
                Free SHS policy. With a strong parliamentary majority,
                the NDC government has a unique opportunity to implement meaningful reforms, backed by legislation, to
                the Free SHS program.</p>

            <p>The NDC government must revisit and develop the community day school program it initiated the last time
                it was in government to deal with some of the challenges of the Free SHS program.
                The community day school program, if implemented properly has the potential for far-reaching benefits to
                all stakeholders.
                It will reduce the financial burden on government and parents since government would no longer bear the
                financial burden of boarding and feeding of students and parents don’t have to commit large amounts of
                financial resources to prepare their children for boarding schools.
                Further, community day schools provide an opportunity for young children to build strong connections and
                a sense of belonging in their communities.
                Leveraging Private Sector Participation
                A major challenge to implementing a day school regime is lack of the necessary infrastructure.
                To address this, government should consider integrating privately operated high schools that meet
                carefully curated standards into the Free SHS system.
                This integration can help alleviate the pressure on public schools and provide students with more
                options to pursue their education within their communities.</p>

            <h3>Decentralizing for Tailored Educational Strategies</h3>
            <p>Decentralizing the management of schools should be another critical consideration for this strategy.
                Each region should have the autonomy to manage its schools in alignment with a national strategy.
                This approach allows for more tailored and region-specific educational plans that address the unique
                needs of each community.
                It also encourages local stakeholders to take ownership of the educational outcomes, fostering a sense
                of responsibility and accountability.</p>

            <p>Implementing these strategies needs active engagement from regional and national stakeholders.
                Involving teacher training institutions, regional education directorates, and community members is
                crucial, as their input will help create an effective and sustainable education system.
                The Free SHS program holds tremendous potential to revolutionize Ghana's education sector. By
                prioritizing structural improvements and ensuring effective implementation, we can develop an education
                system that addresses current demands while preparing students for a successful future.
                Policymakers, educators, and community leaders must come together to ensure that the Free SHS program
                achieves its full potential.
                Now is the time for bold reforms and collaborative efforts to build an equitable, inclusive, and
                future-ready education system for Ghana’s next generation.</p>
